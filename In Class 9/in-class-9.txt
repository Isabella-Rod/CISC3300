9. Exceptions are specific types of errors that occur 
during the execution of a program and can be "caught" to 
handle the error gracefully. In many languages, including PHP, 
exceptions are objects that carry information about the error, 
which can be processed using a try-catch block to prevent the 
program from crashing.
